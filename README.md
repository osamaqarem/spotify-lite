Based on the [Spotify Lite app for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.lite&referrer=adjust_reftag%3Dcc6cp0nuUCn33%26utm_source%3DLanding%2Bpage).

## Try The App

You will need a [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) account to login.

### Android

You can download the latest APK [here](https://github.com/osamaq/spotify-lite/tree/master/docs/apk).

### iOS

You need to build from source. See [development](#Development).

## Development

```bash
# Dependencies
yarn install

# iOS only
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Run iOS
npx react-native run-ios

# Run Android
npx react-native run-android

```

You can also refer to available [npm scripts](https://github.com/osamaq/spotify-lite/blob/b8f763b48ec95ed7e1b4cacfae750b57051cd68e/package.json#L5).

## Notes

- Implicit grant flow is used for authentication with localhost as a redirect URI. In a real application, we probably want to use authorization code flow with a middleware server. See Spotify's [authorization guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorization-flows) for more info.
